## What is Bitcoin
* [White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
* Proof of Work
  * 
* Bitcoin Blockchain
  * Distributed network
  * Public Ledger
* Proof of Work


## What is Ethereum
* Great place to start learn how to use Solidity (would be the best language to learn)
* Cryptocurrency
* Ethereum blockchain is what allows it to exist
* World-wide computer to support applications
* Ethereum 2.0
    * PoW -> PoS

### ERC-20 vs BEP-2/BEP-20
* [Link to the article](https://defiprime.com/binance-smart-chain)
    * This “parallel” blockchain dynamic has led to a situation where the Binance ecosystem has two central token standards (like Ethereum’s ERC-20), which are BEP-2 (the main fungible token standard of Binance Chain) and BEP-20 (the main fungible token standard of BSC). Accordingly, not only are BEP-2 and BEP-20 token addresses distinct from each other in format, they’re also both separate from, though inspired by, ERC-20s.
